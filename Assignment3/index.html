  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>I started my tertiary education at Broward College where I studied Graphic Design. This wasn't my first decision for what I had hoped to study while in college, but nevertheless it was what was available at the time.
    While doing my Associates in Graphic Design, I joined my school's literary and arts magazine.
    After completing my Associates in Graphic Design, I decided to continue my education and get my Bachelor's degree.
  I took a year off from school and worked as a Graphic Design assistant in a small print shop.
  During this time I applied to many Florida universities and finalized my decision of attending UCF in 2017 to study Digital Media.

  <div class="grid-item">
  <h3>Why did you make the decisions along the way which you did?</h3>
  <p>I decided to attend UCF because I wanted to be better qualified for the jobs I was interested in. My decision was ultimately made based on affordability within the state of Florida.
  </p>

  <h3>Ultimately, this task is meant to give you the opportunity to market yourself in a tight space.</h3>
  You need at least 10 content elements here, 4 of which should be images.  Make sure to set up your grid in the HTML

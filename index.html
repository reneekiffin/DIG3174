  <!--About Rococo-->
  <a name="about"><h2 id="about"class="my-1">About Rococo</h2></a>
  <div class="bg-blush p-2 white"><p>Rococo is an ornamental and theatrical style of architecture, art and decoration. It combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and trompe l'oeil frescoes to create the illusion of motion and drama. It first appeared in France and Italy in the 1730s and spread to Central Europe in the 1750s and 1760s. It is often considered the final expression of the Baroque movement. </p>

<!-- Origin and Influences -->
  <a name="origin"><h2 id="origin"class="my-1">Origin and Influence</h1></a>
  <div class="bg-blush p-2 mb-2 white"><p>The word Rococo is a variation of the term <i>rocaille</i>. Originally rocaille was a method of decoration which used pebbles, shells and cement to decorate grottoes and fountains since the Renaissance. However, during the late Style Lious XIV, in the late 17th and 18th century, the term was used to describe decorative motifs and ornaments in the forms of shells interlaced with acanthus leaves. This form of rocaille was used to decorate doorways, furniture, wall penels and other architectural structures.

  The term <i>rococo</i> was first used to describe decoration which was old fashioned. In the 19th century, it was then used to decribe architecture or music which was very ornamental.

<p>
  The Rocaille style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign of Louis XV, and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.[18] The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests

<p>
  Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from Guardi or other painters, or Chinoiserie, against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the Venetian school of painters whose work decorated the salons.

<p>
In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste" and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe, although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. William Hogarth helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty.

  <p id = "intro">This page is meant to go over some familiar concepts while exploring
    some new ones.  We've covered a fair bit of content over the course of this semester,
    and everything is fair game for the final major assignment.  We are hitting all the
    major topics discussed in labs over the course of this semester.  That means we are
    going to hit the head tag, CSS, grids, images, and SASS.</p>

      <p>This should feel very familiar by now.  We are at the start of the index.html page.
      A lot of these lines of script should be in a template so that you can bring them in whenever
      you need them.  In the head section, there is the title (displayed in browser tab), viewport,
      CSS link, and favicon link.  Note that favicons should be in the ico format, and they will not
      display in Edge without a server request (in other words, they won't be visible in Edge until you
      upload your site to the server.)  In terms of getting ready for the final, this stuff is bare minimum
      in terms of best practices.  Make sure you have it down.</p>

      <h2>Example</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "grid-item n6">
      <p>Fundemental to localized control of a website are classes and ids.  Classes are deeply flexible.
      They can be used to apply formatting to groups of elements thanks to nesting (which is why we often
      use them with divs).  Ids, on the other hand, are precision tools.  An id is a unique identifier
      (hence the name), so they are used when one element needs a little extra attention, but you don't want
      the rest of your page to be affected by the CSS.  In this case, I am using the class "nav" to set up
      a simple grid.  Much more interesting are the classes "left" and "right."  Using a media query, these
      h1 tags are aligned on either side of the site in a wide display and centered in a narrow one.  The id
      "intro" is being used to add margins to the p element on line 29.  I cannot simply apply it to all p
      tags because it would then muck up paragraphs like the one you're reading right now.</p>

      <h2>Images</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "grid-item n11">
      <h2>Example</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "grid-item n10">
      <p>As content elements, images often represent the trouble makers.  Simply put, they are not easy to style
      in the way that we can other elements.  However, they represented a significant improvement for the early web
      and are a hallmark of the modern internet.  They are efficient information delivery systems that get to concepts
      which would be much more difficult without them.  Thus, we put up with their difficulties.  In the case of this
      page, they solved a conceptual problem.  Printing HTML on a website is a drag.  You can do it, but it's quite
      a headache and makes the index file much less readable.  Using screenshots from the script files is a tidy
      solution to that problem.  In this case, the example is showing an img srcset, complete with a fallback image
      two sizes, and alt text.  You likely will only need to worry about source sets when using an image heavy site
       but having that skill in your pocket will make those sites much more useful on mobile (especially when users
       are off wifi).</p>

      <p>Reviewing preprocessors creates a unique conceptual problem.  We talked about them pretty late in the semester,
      but they are best when implemented from the start of a project.  The reason for this disparity is where the learning curve
      lies.  You have to understand CSS as a style language in order to get any mileage out of SASS.  Thus, for this review,
      I begin with the SCSS files in order to show how they work with the CSS concepts.  We've talked about modularity, and lines
      2-6 illustrate this idea.  The file architechture is laid out on the top.  There is index, our main html page, main.css, the
      single output style file (which is quite large), then main.scss (the file that is being processed into a CSS file),
      mixins.scss (which contains, unsurprisingly, mixins), and stylevars.scss (which holds the variables we are using).  This is a good time
      to remind you that you have all of these source files.  Feel free to look them over as you are going through this page.  In the second
      image, you can see that the margins are being set by a variable (which is delcared in stylevars.scss).</p>

        <img src="img/mqgridwide.png" alt="a series of imports and includes in main.scss lines 2-6">
        <p class = "note">***It is worth it to go back to media queries and grids for a moment here.  Media queries typically
          rely on min or max width, and these set up break points.  As for grids, they give us flexibility on how
          content is displayed on the page.  In this case, the header section is an auto spaced 2 col grid, and the
          grid in the body is 2 columns, but those columns are spaced into 3/7 and 4/7 (giving slightly more space to the image
          column).</p>

      <h2>Variables</h2>

      <p>When bulding a group of SASS files, doing so with an eye to
      efficiency and modularity is important.  In this case, I wanted
      some options on the font that I would be using.  Because this is
      a site that is talking about scripting, I wanted that feel throughout.
        One way to capture that is through a monospace font.  Looking at
      main.scss, it is clear that I used a set of variables for the fonts on
      h1, h2, and p.  Having this setup makes testing easy.  Just as importantly,
      I now have these font names lined out with a bit of description.  In lines
      18-20 of stylevars.scss, I can assign them quickly, and it will update
      automatically in my main.css file (I wasn't certain what margins and pads
      I wanted on the sides in the desk version, so the $space variable was helpful
      in making those tweaks).  <br><br>Some of you have expressed concerns about how these
      variables are useful.  To be clear, they are not variables for the user.  They
      don't add functionality to the finished site.  This might make them feel
      less dynamic than variables in something like Javascript, but this is
      more of a conceptual issue.  The variables aren't for the user.  They are for
      you (the developer).  They make spot tweaking the site a breeze.  They make
      automation of tasks that would take a while quicker.  (more on that in the
      next section).</p>

    <div class = "grid-item n20">
        <img src="img/vars.png" alt="Variables declared in stylevars.scss (lines 3-23) and thier use in main.scss (lines

      <h2>Mixins</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "grid-item n23">
      <h2>Example</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "grid-item n22">
      <p>Automating tasks is a good thing.  It frees up time for you
      to be creative.  These mixins are demonstrative of this idea
      that you can create a task here and not have to worry about it.
      As we were just talking about typography above, take a look at line 11.
      Each of those fonts in the stylevars page is from Google.  Now, we could
      update the statement every single time to import those fonts.  Or, we can
      just inject the correct variable directly into the URL.  Remember, in
      lines 2 and 3 of main.scss, I imported the mixins and stylevars
      files.  However, that just menas they are available.  They have to be used
      in a way that will meaningfully impact the css for the script to actually write.
      Thus, when I incldue font (line 6 of main.scss), it drops all three of those font
      imports.  And it makes the selction based on the values of those variables.<br>
      <br>  Jumping back up to line 2 of mixins.scss, this automates a process that
      would take an exhaustive amount of time to do manually.  And it solves a problem
      which has been lurking in this project's design.  The basic setup for this project is a
      2 column grid that drops to 1 after the breakpoint.  The issue is how this is
      displayed.  The format for a row (in 2 col view) is HSection / HExample or text/image .
      This works out like a table and displays information logically because text is always
      under header for its section, and the image is always under the header for the example.
      But, once the page drops to 1 col, the row format changes. The headers are stacked and
      so are the content boxes.  This is why the class  group n# was created.  In desktop view,
      the grid is displayed based on the order of items in the HTML, in mobile, it is displayed
      based on the numeric ordering of the n# class assigned to it.<br>
      <br>The easy answer, then, is to automate it based on the number of rows.
      In my case, I have been updating the $grid-rows variable with each new section I add (adding 4),
      and this has let me see the output immediately.  The @for statement says to start with
      $i=1 and generate a line (or group) of CSS until it reaches the upper limit set by $grid-rows.
      In the second image here, the css has the correct position of each item in mobile based on
      the n# class it was given in the html.<br>
      <br>Remember that this process only gets used when it is actually included.  In my case,
      the include command is on line 15 of main.scss.  It is within the mobile sizing, and after the
      grid declaration.  The benefit of this is that I wrote 9 lines of CSS and output 70 lines.  Automation

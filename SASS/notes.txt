prefers scss

.sass makes a lot of assumptions


How is this a valuable thing to do? to have variables that store information?

*SASS*
is a preprocessor file. a file that cannot be read by the browser.
- using a terminal
- install a third party program to output the file (http://koala-app.com/)
solve and reduces common repetition
uses scss or sass extension

What are variables and mixins?

**variables**
- a way to store information
  strings, numbers. colors, booleans, lists, nulls
  uses $symbol followed by name

  Syntax
  $variablename: value;

  SCSS Syntax Example:
      $myFont: Helvetica, sans-serif;
      $myColor: red;
      $myFontSize: 18px;
      $myWidth: 680px;

      body {
        font-family: $myFont;
        font-size: $myFontSize;
        color: $myColor;
      }

      #container {
        width: $myWidth;
      }


      CSS Output Example:

      body {
        font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
        font-size: 18px;
        color: red;
      }

      #container {
        width: 680px;
      }


**What is a @mixin**
a box/modular container you can put functionality into

you're giving the name to this packet. his packet is called fancy. if someone if using this name with the import command it loads this packet.

Example:

@mixin fancy{
    h1{
        font-family: $fancy1;
    }
    p{
        font-family: $fancy2;
    }
}
